{"name":"Soccer Juggle Journal","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to my juggle journal\r\n\r\nMy name is Jack. I'm 7 years old and I love to play soccer. On April 1, 2014, I started a juggle journal to track how many juggles I can get in a row. Here is a [video](https://vimeo.com/91025572) of me juggling during my first week.\r\n\r\n### How the juggle journal works\r\n\r\nI juggle for at least 15 minutes every day and write down my highest number of juggles on a piece of paper and then I add them to this site. My dad created this site and showed me how to add things to it.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of rules for my juggles to count:\r\n\r\n1. I have to start with the ball on the ground and use my feet to get it into the air.\r\n2. Most of the juggles need to be with my feet.\r\n\r\nI love to juggle a soccer ball. It helps with my touch and gives me lots of confidence playing soccer. I hope I can help other kids to start juggle journals and track their juggles too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
