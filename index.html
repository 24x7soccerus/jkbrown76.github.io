<p>My name is Jack. I'm 7 years old and I love to play soccer. On April 1, 2014, I started a juggle journal to track how many juggles I can get in a row. Here is a <a href="https://vimeo.com/91025572">video</a> of me juggling during my first week.</p>

<p>I juggle for 15 minutes every day and write down my highest number of juggles on a piece of paper and then I add them to this site. My dad created this site and showed me how to add things to it.</p>

<p>There are a couple of rules for my juggles to count:</p>

<ol>
<li>I must start with the ball on the ground and use my feet to get it into the air.</li>
<li>Most of the juggles need to be with my feet.</li>
</ol><p>I love to juggle a soccer ball. It helps with my touch and gives me lots of confidence playing soccer.I hope I can help other kids to start juggle journals and track their juggles too.</p>
